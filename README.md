# Combi-CAM: A Novel Grad-CAM Approach for Geolocalization Explainability

Official repository for  Combi-CAM: A Novel Grad-CAM Approach for Geolocalization Explainability paper.

## Inference with explainability methods:

```bash
!python inference.py --image_url "..." --use_cpu --layercam --gradcam --gradcamplusplus --scorecam --combicam
```

Recommended to generate figures one by one to avoid RAM overload.

It is also possible to use --image_path instead of --image_url.
